3.  **Set up the Database:**
    * Ensure your MySQL server is running.
    * Run the `schema.sql` file (located in the project root) in your MySQL client to create the database and all tables.
4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` root folder.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` into it and fill in your MySQL password and a JWT secret.
